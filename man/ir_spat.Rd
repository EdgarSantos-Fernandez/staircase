  diff = "id",
  y,

}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{Formula in the form of a linear model (see ?lm())}

\item{data}{Long data frame containing the locations, dates, covariates and the response variable. It has to have the locID and date. No missing values are allowed in the covariates.}

\item{spat_model}{String with the spatial correlation structure based on Euclidean distance models. The options are: exponential (exp), spherical (sph), gaussian (gau), car (Conditional Autoregressive). For no spatial autocorrelation use "none".}

\item{itemtype}{String with the kind of item response model. Options: 3PLUS, 2PLUS, 1PLUS, 3PL, 2PL and 1PL. PLUS and PL models are spatial and non-spatial respectivelly.}

\item{abil}{Column indicating the user id}

\item{diff}{Column indicating the item id}

\item{y}{Binary response variable (1 = correct, 0 = otherwise).}

\item{coords}{A vector with the longitude and latitude for Euclidean distance models.}

\item{iter}{Number of iterations}

\item{warmup}{The number of warm up sample iterations that are performed}

\item{chains}{Number of chains}

\item{seed}{(optional) A seed for reproducibility}

\item{refresh}{The refresh rate showing the progress}

\item{loglik}{If the log-likelihood will be computed (True/False)}
}
\value{
Returns a list with the model fit.

Fits a spatial item response model using Stan

\details{
Missing values are not allowed in the covariates and they must be
imputed before using ir_spat(). Many options can be found in
https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MissingData.html.\cr\cr The probability
that a user correctly identified a point is specified by the equation:\cr\cr
\figure{probability.png}{options: align="middle"}\cr\cr The item type parameter
 in the ir_spat function can receive any of the Models in the first column:\cr
